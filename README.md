# -Vinho-Verde_SVM
The dataset is related to white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

The dataset is related to white variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine.

Input variables (based on physicochemical tests):
   1. - fixed acidity
   2. - volatile acidity
   3. - citric acid
   4. - residual sugar
   5. - chlorides
   6. - free sulfur dioxide
   7. - total sulfur dioxide
   8. - density
   9. - pH
   10. - sulphates
   11. - alcohol
   
Output variable (based on sensory data): 
   12. - quality (score between 0 and 10)</b>

Our goal is to predict the quality of wine based on the features using <b><u>SVM Model</u></b>
